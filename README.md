##Introduction.
Hypertension is a silent killer, you probably won't first experience any symptoms. It develops into a chronic illness over time, eventually causing symptoms including headaches and chest pain.
Regularly checking your blood pressure can protect you from heart illnesses.
The biggest cause of death in the US is cardiovascular disease. The number of deaths from heart disease grew by 4.8% in 2020, which is the highest increase since 2012.
A recurring relationship between cardiac problems and potentially catastrophic results is hypertension. Risk factors might be either modifiable (heavy alcohol consumption and an unhealthy lifestyle) or immutable (family history of hypertension). But one thing is certain: hypertension is typically an illness that may be avoided.
In order to acquire patient health data without unduly taxing hospitals and emergency rooms, remote patient monitoring (RPM) was developed. Our chronic patients' quality of life has considerably improved because to remote monitoring. Remote patient monitoring has today's opened doors to more digital health treatments, collaborating with insurers and billing firms to deliver more convenience to patients, as it brought continuity of care among patients with COVID-19 (DrKumo, 2022).
